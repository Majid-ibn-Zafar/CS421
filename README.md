# CS421
Assignments from CS421, Summer 2021

1. Folders labeled 'group project' and 'healthcare wireframe layout' are collaborations with 3 other individuals. This is the project we presented in CS421.
2. The rest of the folders are my own assignments that I had to do during the summer semester for this course.
